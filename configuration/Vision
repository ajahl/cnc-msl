Localisation:
	-Initialpoint for localisation can be found in the Localization.conf in the etc folder
	-TODO reference from MSLFotballField

Visioncalibration:
	1. calibrate center of the camera in the picture, cameraMX and cameraMY can be found in the Vision.conf for each robot
	the calibration is needed for correct the center of the mirror 
		1.1 you can connect to the robot via lan by connecting the lan cable in the slot where the beagle board acctually is connected to
			To connect via ssh t the robot you need a static ip like 10.0.0.x, the 10, 1 are already taken so choose any other
		1.2 to do this connect via lan to the robot and type in a console: "rosrun msl_vision msl_visoin --drawCircle"
	2. calibrate the colors
		2.1 on the robot type in a console: "coriander", to get a picture, go to the Services Tab and press Receive and then Display.
		2.2 now you have a video stream from the camera. The intention is to calibrate a high kontrast between green, yellow/orange and white
		2.3 to do so you need to go to the Controls Tab and play with the settings.
		2.4 for the sharpnes its important to take lines far away and calibrate that these lines ar not shining
		2.5 if your done write the settings in the vision.conf for the taken robot
		2.6 to detect if the robot sees the ball run on the robot: "rosrun msl_vision msl_vision --gray --drawROI" the cross marks the ball but! the cross is the projection of the ball to the ground
	3. run on your pc: "rosrun msl_udp_proxy msl_udp_proxy" and "rosrun msl_color_calibrator msl_color_calibrator" and start the vision on the robot : "rosrun msl_vision msl_visoin --false"
		3.1 the important tab in the tool is the roi, to get a picture select the robot of your choice and press "selected".
		3.2 now for manipulating the "LookupTable" you can either add colors by click and drag left mouse button in the picture, Lookupablte or to remove colors with the right mouse button
		3.3 to save the lookuptable you can direct to the menubar, File -> Save LookupTable to File, the directory has to be in the config folder of the selected robot
	4. localize the robot on the previously set point
		4.1 run the vison on the robot and kill the process manager too
		4.2 run "rosrun msl_vision_data_viewer msl_vision_data_viewer" on the robot with an X server session on the robot
		4.3 you see red and green linepoints, the red ones are the lines detected from the robot and the green ones from the expected field
		4.4 now you take 2 red lines which should be parallel and calibrate the screws at the mirror so that the red lines are parallel
		4.5 hint: turn the robot that one  "sträben" is  parallel to the selected lines, and now you can play wtih the screw of the "sräbe"
	5. Obstacles
		! ask andy how to see obstales in the msl_vision and ask how to see the Blobs
	6. scan lines
		6.1 
	7. distance scan
		!!
		7.1 delete distanceLookup.txt in the etc folder of the robot if 

		!TOOLS needed!
		rosrun carpet_calibrator carpet_calibrator_line_points
             	rosrun msl_vision msl_carpet_calculator

	8. calibrate ball in kicker
